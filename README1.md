Here is a link to an article I find pretty interesting: (super interesting article)[https://towardsdatascience.com/encapsulation-a-software-engineering-concept-data-scientists-must-know-to-succeed-b3b1a0a42a41/]

## I find this article interesting because: 
This article is particularly compelling for data science students because it bridges the gap between pure data analysis and the crucial software engineering practices that are often overlooked in academic settings. While many students focus heavily on algorithms, statistics, and model-building, this article highlights the importance of writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code—skills that are essential for turning data science projects into reliable, scalable solutions in the real world. By introducing the concept of encapsulation with practical examples, it teaches how to structure code in a way that not only makes it easier to understand but also reduces bugs and facilitates collaboration, which are critical when working on real data science teams.

Moreover, the article’s real-world approach resonates strongly with data science students preparing for industry roles. It demonstrates how common challenges like messy data and code fragility can be systematically addressed through thoughtful design rather than quick fixes. The detailed examples of refactoring data cleaning steps into well-documented functions show how even simple engineering principles can dramatically improve productivity and code quality. For students who aspire to become professionals, this article is a reminder that mastering software engineering concepts, such as encapsulation, is just as important as mastering data science techniques, and that doing so will set them apart as capable and professional data scientists ready to deliver impactful solutions.
